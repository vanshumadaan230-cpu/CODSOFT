During the CodSoft Web Development Internship, interns are given the opportunity to build foundational skills in front-end web development through hands-on projects. The internship involves designing and developing key components of a website, including a modern, responsive Landing Page, a personalized Portfolio Website, and a functional Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tasks help interns understand the core principles of UI/UX design, responsive layouts, DOM manipulation, and user interactivity. Through these projects, interns not only strengthen their coding abilities but also learn how to create visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces, preparing them for real-world development scenarios.
